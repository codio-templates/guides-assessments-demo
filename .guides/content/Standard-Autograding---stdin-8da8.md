`First Number :`
`Last Number :`

... and then output the result as 

`Total : <total>`

### This button is just for testing the code
The command text for this button is `{Test Me | terminal}(stdin/test.sh)` and you should note that the `| terminal` is required in order to ensure that the testing happens in a terminal window as the Guide cannot handle user input.

{Test Me | terminal}(stdin/test.sh)

## Reference Information
This example is good for dealing with code that expects input from `stdin`. This can be useful when allowing students to input values when testing but is still testable by the Codio autograding engine.

Please refer to the [Standard Code Test](https://codio.com/docs/content/authoring/assessments/assessments-standard-code-tests/) documentation for details on how to configure it and look for the standard input example.
