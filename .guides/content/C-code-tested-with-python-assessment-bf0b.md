{Check It!|assessment}(test-4112607060)

## Explanation
Above is a automated test assessment example. It invites the student to write some code in c. The test, however, is written in python `test.py` and is shown in the bottom left pane.

You would not normally show the test to students, of course. This is done just to show you the matching test.
