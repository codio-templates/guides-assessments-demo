Codio can run any programming language, dynamic or compiled, that is available for Ubuntu. Your projects can included one or many thousands of source code files. 

Below is a multi-file c++ example and the IDE has been configured with two custom buttons to compile and run the sample program. The program can also be compiled and run from the terminal. You can edit the buttons or create your own by editing the .codio file which stores a JSON configuration. 

- Compile Hello World: Compiles the program with g++
- Run Hello World: Executes the compiled binary
