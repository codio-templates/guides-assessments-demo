## Explanation
Standard autograding is a fantastic way of creating autograded code tests without needing to write a single line of code yourself. 

This example passes in arguments from the test to the student code and compares it with expected output. 

There are two (but there can be more) sets of argument data passed in to avoid students simply outputting a known string.

Multiple test runs are especially useful for testing different conditions that need to be taken into account by the student.

You should refer to the [standard code test](https://docs.codio.com/instructors/authoring/assessments/standard-code-test.html) documentation for details on how to configure it.
