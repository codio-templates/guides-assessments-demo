### Line Based Grader
The line based grader is a way to quickly and easily make Parson’s problems with a single right answer. This grader does not require you to use a certain programming language which makes it a great way to abstract processes and workflows one level higher than actual code.

### Variable Check Grader
The variable check grader is for Python problems where students are manipulating variables. You can set the variables of interest before the student code and check them after – meaning this grader checks the **functionality** of student code so it’s okay that there is more than one right answer!

### Unit Test Grader
The unit test grader is for Python problems where students are creating functions. Similar to traditional unit tests on code, this grader leverages a unittest framework where you set asserts – meaning this grader checks the **functionality** of student code so it’s okay that there is more than one right answer!

### Language Translation Grader
The language translation grader is for Java and psuedocode problems with functionality similar to the variable check grader described above. The main difference being you map the Java or psuedo code blocks to python in the background. Selecting the language allows the Parson’s problem to check for correct indention and syntax.

### Turtle Grader
The Turtle grader uses the [Python Turtle library](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html) to allow students to write turtle code! Either use native python or map psuedo code to python commands (similar to the language translation grader) for student code. With the click of a button, generate the solution code the grader checks student answers against.
