You can use any dynamic or compiled programming language in Codio that is available in Ubuntu. Your projects can also be any size, from one source file to open source behemoths with millions of lines of code. 

You can easily program in Ada, ActionScript, Bash, BASIC, C/C++, C#, COBOL, CoffeeScript D, Dart, Erlang, ECMAScript, Fortran, Go, Groovy, Haskell, Haxe, Java, JavaScript, Jython, Logo, Lua, lisp, make, .Net, Nim, Processing.js, Pascal, Python, Perl, PHP, R, Racket, Rust, Ruby, Scala, Scheme, Scratch, Smalltalk, Tcl, Visual Basic(vb2Py) and many more.


Below is a multi-file C and Makefile example program. The IDE has been configured with two custom buttons to compile and run the sample program. You can edit the buttons or create your own by editing the .codio file which stores a JSON configuration. 



- Build: Call `make` to build and compile the C program.
- Run: Executes the compiled binary.
