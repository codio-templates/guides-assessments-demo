### Solution
This solution will only be shown to teachers.

``` html
	<ul>
		<li>one</li>
		<li>two</li>
		<li>three</li>
	</ul>
```

## Explanation
The above example shows how to use libraries to help build more complex testing scenarios. The test file is `challenge4/test4.js`. 

It uses the cheerio package to read and process the HTML into a DOM structure that can then be queried with jquery syntax. 

Processing this, and especially more complex HTML, would be painful to code from scratch.
